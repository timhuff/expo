Many mobile apps need to load resources from a remote URL. You may want to make a POST request to a REST API, or you may simply need to fetch a chunk of static content from another server.

## Using Fetch

React Native provides the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) for your networking needs. Fetch will seem familiar if you have used `XMLHttpRequest` or other networking APIs before. You may refer to MDN's guide on [Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for additional information.

#### Making requests

In order to fetch content from an arbitrary URL, just pass the URL to fetch:


```javascript

fetch('https://mywebsite.com/mydata.json');

```


Fetch also takes an optional second argument that allows you to customize the HTTP request. You may want to specify additional headers, or make a POST request:


```javascript

fetch('https://mywebsite.com/endpoint/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Accept: 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    firstParam: 'yourValue',
    secondParam: 'yourOtherValue',
  }),
});

```


Take a look at the [Fetch Request docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) for a full list of properties.

#### Handling the response

The above examples show how you can make a request. In many cases, you will want to do something with the response.

Networking is an inherently asynchronous operation. Fetch methods will return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that makes it straightforward to write code that works in an asynchronous manner:


```javascript

function getMoviesFromApiAsync() {
  return fetch('https://facebook.github.io/react-native/movies.json')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((responseJson) => {
      return responseJson.movies;
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
    });
}

```


You can also use the proposed ES2017 `async`/`await` syntax in a React Native app:


```javascript

async function getMoviesFromApi() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch(
      'https://facebook.github.io/react-native/movies.json',
    );
    let responseJson = await response.json();
    return responseJson.movies;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

```


Don't forget to catch any errors that may be thrown by `fetch`, otherwise they will be dropped silently.


```javascript

import React from 'react';
import { FlatList, ActivityIndicator, Text, View  } from 'react-native';

export default class FetchExample extends React.Component {

  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state ={ isLoading: true}
  }

  componentDidMount(){
    return fetch('https://facebook.github.io/react-native/movies.json')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((responseJson) => {

        this.setState({
          isLoading: false,
          dataSource: responseJson.movies,
        }, function(){

        });

      })
      .catch((error) =>{
        console.error(error);
      });
  }



  render(){

    if(this.state.isLoading){
      return(
        <View style={{flex: 1, padding: 20}}>
          <ActivityIndicator/>
        </View>
      )
    }

    return(
      <View style={{flex: 1, paddingTop:20}}>
        <FlatList
          data={this.state.dataSource}
          renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.title}, {item.releaseYear}</Text>}
          keyExtractor={({id}, index) => id}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

```


> By default, iOS will block any request that's not encrypted using SSL. If you need to fetch from a cleartext URL (one that begins with `http`) you will first need to add an App Transport Security exception. If you know ahead of time what domains you will need access to, it is more secure to add exceptions just for those domains; if the domains are not known until runtime you can disable ATS completely. Note however that from January 2017, [Apple's App Store review will require reasonable justification for disabling ATS](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/48979). See [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33) for more information.

### Using Other Networking Libraries

The [XMLHttpRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) is built in to React Native. This means that you can use third party libraries such as [frisbee](https://github.com/niftylettuce/frisbee) or [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) that depend on it, or you can use the XMLHttpRequest API directly if you prefer.


```javascript

var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.onreadystatechange = (e) => {
  if (request.readyState !== 4) {
    return;
  }

  if (request.status === 200) {
    console.log('success', request.responseText);
  } else {
    console.warn('error');
  }
};

request.open('GET', 'https://mywebsite.com/endpoint/');
request.send();

```


> The security model for XMLHttpRequest is different than on web as there is no concept of [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) in native apps.

## WebSocket Support

React Native also supports [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket), a protocol which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.


```javascript

var ws = new WebSocket('ws://host.com/path');

ws.onopen = () => {
  // connection opened
  ws.send('something'); // send a message
};

ws.onmessage = (e) => {
  // a message was received
  console.log(e.data);
};

ws.onerror = (e) => {
  // an error occurred
  console.log(e.message);
};

ws.onclose = (e) => {
  // connection closed
  console.log(e.code, e.reason);
};

```


## Known Issues with `fetch` and cookie based authentication

The following options are currently not working with `fetch`

- `redirect:manual`
- `credentials:omit`

* Having same name headers on Android will result in only the latest one being present. A temporary solution can be found here: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/18837#issuecomment-398779994.
* Cookie based authentication is currently unstable. You can view some of the issues raised here: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23185
* As a minimum on iOS, when redirected through a `302`, if a `Set-Cookie` header is present, the cookie is not set properly. Since the redirect cannot be handled manually this might cause a scenario where infinite requests occur if the redirect is the result of an expired session.
